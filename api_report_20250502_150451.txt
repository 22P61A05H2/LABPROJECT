Here's a concise report summarizing the information:

VBIT, the Vignana Bharathi Institute of Technology in Ghatkesar, Hyderabad, recently hosted an event called AlgoVeda. The event appears to have been a coding competition featuring multiple levels, with participants noting that the initial levels (up to 6) were relatively easy, while level 7 presented a more challenging opportunity to showcase their coding skills.
